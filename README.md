We obtained a single-cell RNA-sequencing pan-cancer atlas of 53 human bone metastases from 12 different origins and 39 paired primary tumor and normal bone marrow tissues. Integrative analysis with large-scale primary and metastatic pan-cancer and healthy bone marrow scRNA-seq datasets revealed specific cellular and molecular features in the bone microenvironment.

We have developed a data platform for researchers to access and utilize our datasets, available atï¼šhttp://www.sunlab.fun:8888/scBoneAtlas/
